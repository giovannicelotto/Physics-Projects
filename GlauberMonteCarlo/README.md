# Glauber Monte Carlo Simulation
The ROOT macro mcg.C provides a Monte Carlo Simulation based on the semiclassical Glauber model that estimates the number of collisions between nucleons and number of participant nucleons in a scattering between two nuclei of Pb-208.
The ROOT macro functions.C has to be loaded first.
