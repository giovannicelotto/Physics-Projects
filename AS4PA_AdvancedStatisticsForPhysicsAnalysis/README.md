# Advanced Statistic For Physics Analysis (2021-2022)
All the completed exercises of the course Advanced Statistic For Physics Analysis (AS4PA) of the year 2021-2022 (https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082557/N0)

### Topics of the course:
- review of basic concepts: probability, odds and rules, updating probabilites, uncertain numbers (probability functions)
- from Bernoulli trials to Poisson processes and related distributions
- Bernoulli theorem and Central Limit Theorem
- Inference of the Bernoulli p; inference of lambda of the Poisson distribution. Inference of the Gaussian mu. Simultaneous inference of mu and sigma from a sample: general ideas and asymptotic results (large sample size).
- fits as special case of parametric inference
- Monte Carlo methods: rejecion sampling, inversion of cumulative distributions, importance sampling. Metropolis algorithm as example of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Simulated annealing
- the R framework and language for applied statistics.
