# Double Pendulum
The aim of the code is to solve numerically equations of motion for a double pendulum.
Input parameters are the lenghts of the two pendulum, and the initial conditions (two angles and generalized momenta of the Hamiltonian)
The solution of the ODE is performed through the 4th-Order Runge Kutta Method
