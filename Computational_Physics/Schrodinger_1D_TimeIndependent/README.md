# 1D Schrodinger Equation Time Independent
The aim of the code is to find numerically a solution for the 1D time independent Schrodinger Equation for a particle inside a box with a given potential.
The potential of the Schrodinger equation can be choosen between the following options:

* Zero Potential
* Linear Potential
* Cosinusoidal Potential
* Gaussian Potential

The solution of the equation is performed through the shooting method and Numerov's algorithm.
